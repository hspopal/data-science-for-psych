# Introduction to Coding

Below are some online tutorials that you can use to teach yourself coding in various languages

## Python
- [Codeacademy Tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
    - An introduction to python for beginners
    - No coding knowledge required
    - Gives you a basic coding foundation from if-statements and for-loops, to more advanced python scripting
    - I would recommend that you complete the whole course, but do not stress memorizing everything
    - Get a general idea of how coding works and what you can do, then you can go back and google solutions to your problems

### Useful Packages
- Pandas - for basic data management and data analysis
Never use excel again! Instead you'll learn to use dataframes (like a spreadsheet for python) to store, manipulate,
and analyze your data
